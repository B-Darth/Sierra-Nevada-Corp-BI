## Problem Statement

SN Corp, a leading sales organization, needs to gain insights into its sales performance to inform business decisions and drive growth. The organization has collected a large dataset of sales transactions, including customer information, order dates, ship modes, and sales amounts. However, the data is scattered and difficult to analyze, making it challenging for stakeholders to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.


### Steps followed 

- Cards:
  1. Created three cards to display key metrics: total sales, total cost, and total profit.
  2. Connected the cards to the dataset using Power BI's data modeling feature.
  3. Configured the card visuals to display the desired metrics and formatting.

- Table:
  1. Created a table visualization to display customer-level data.
  2. Selected the relevant columns from the dataset, including customer name, sum of sales, sum of cost, and sum of profit.
  3. Configured the table to allow users to drill down into customer-level details.

- Clustered Column Chart:
  1. Created a clustered column chart to display the sum of sales by sub-category.
  2. Selected the relevant columns from the dataset, including sub-category and sum of sales.
  3. Configured the chart to group the data by sub-category and display the sum of sales for each category.

- Pie Chart:
  1. Created a pie chart to display the quantity of sales by region.
  2. Selected the relevant columns from the dataset, including region and quantity of sales.
  3. Configured the chart to display the data as a proportion of the total sales.

- Line Chart:
  1. Created a line chart to display total orders by quarter and year.
  2. Selected the relevant columns from the dataset, including order date and total orders.
  3. Configured the chart to display the data over time, with separate lines for each year.

- Map Chart:
  1. Created a map chart to display country-level sales data.
  2. Selected the relevant columns from the dataset, including country and sales amount.
  3. Configured the chart to display the data as bubble sizes, with larger bubbles indicating higher sales amounts.

- Slicers:
  1. Created two slicers: ship mode and order date.
  2. Configured the slicers to filter the data based on user selection.
  3. Connected the slicers to the relevant visualizations to update the data accordingly.

- Text Box:
  1. Created a text box to display the report title, "SN Corp".
  2. Configured the text box to display the title prominently at the top of the report.

            These steps were followed to create each visualization in the report, providing a comprehensive and interactive view of SN Corp's sales performance. The added screenshot provides a visual representation of the final report, showcasing the various components and features.
